# Read alignment


This project implements the genome alignment algorithm SNAP. 

Final results:
	the program works, but there is memroy leak, and it will take tons of memory to run the program if the reference genome is too big. (about 1GB RAM for a 5MB ref because the algorithm itself requires that much)

	Not very good results. But still, there are many useful implementations in this project, especially the hashTable, AVL-tree and binaryCompressing of ref.
